# DNS-Talker
This program talks with microsofts DNS server in order to get the IP-address of the website

Please fell free to learn from this code but DO NOT copy the code completely. Doing so may be considered plagerism.

Also, I only coded the server file, all the other code is written by Rutgers staff and order websites listen in the other readme
