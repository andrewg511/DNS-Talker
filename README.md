# DNS-Talker
This program talks with microsofts DNS server in order to get the IP-address of websites

Please fell free to learn from this code but DO NOT copy the code completely. Doing so may be considered plagiarism.

Also, I only coded the server file, all the other code is written by Rutgers staff and other websites listed in the other readme
